## 🚀 Features

- User authentication via Google Sign-In.
- Event browsing and detailed view.
- Sign up for events with integration to Google Calendar.
- Admin functionality to create and manage events.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Android Studio Flamingo or later
- Java 8+
- Firebase Account (Firestore, Authentication)
- Google API Credentials (OAuth 2.0 Client IDs)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
```

### 2. Open the Project

- Launch Android Studio and open the cloned project directory.

### 3. Firebase Configuration

- Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
- Register your Android app with the package name: `com.jveventsplatform.eventsplatformandroidui`
- Generate and download the `google-services.json` file from Firebase.
- Place `google-services.json` into your project's `app/` directory.

### 4. Google OAuth Setup

- Navigate to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Set up an OAuth 2.0 Client ID for Android.
- Add your SHA-1 fingerprint (Debug and Release fingerprints) to the credentials.

**Generate SHA-1 fingerprint:**

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```

**For Release SHA-1:**

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore <path-to-your-release-keystore.jks> -alias <your-key-alias>
```

- Enter these fingerprints into Firebase under Project Settings → Android App.

### 5. Configure the API

- The app relies on a backend REST API. Ensure your API server is running and that you POST events with Postman, unless you are an admin and can add events throught the application's UI.
- Update the API base URL in `RetrofitClient.kt` if necessary.

### 6. Firestore Database

- Start Firestore Database in Production or Test Mode (recommended Test initially).
- Configure security rules in your Firebase console.

#### Firebase Security Rules

This application uses Firebase Firestore. You must configure appropriate security rules to protect user data and ensure proper permissions.

A recommended minimum rule structure:

- Ensure users can only access their own data.
- Restrict event creation and modification to admin users.

**Important:** Always configure your own rules securely in your Firebase Console.

### 7. Set up Keystore for Release Builds

- Create `keystore.properties` in your project root directory:

```properties
storeFile=./app/Android_Release_Keys/release-keystore.jks
storePassword=your_keystore_password
keyAlias=your_key_alias
keyPassword=your_key_password
```

### 8. Install Dependencies

- Dependencies will be automatically handled by Gradle.
- Sync your project with Gradle files (`File → Sync Project with Gradle Files`).

### 9. Run the App

- Connect an Android device or emulator.
- Run the application by clicking the Run button or pressing `Shift+F10`.

## 🧑‍💻 Development

- **Admin Features:** Admin users can manage events and user roles via the Admin panel accessible through the Profile fragment.
- **Debugging:** Use Android Studio's Logcat for debugging.

## 🛡 Security Recommendations

- **Never commit sensitive information** (API keys, keystore passwords) to version control. Always use `keystore.properties` or environment variables.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

### 🛠️ Admin Features
- Ability for admins to **update** existing events  
- Ability for admins to **delete** events  
- View a list of users and their roles (e.g., promote/demote users)

### 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements
- Redesign **Add Event** form for a cleaner and more modern layout  
- Use **DatePicker** and **TimePicker** dialogs instead of manual text input  
- Improve spacing, padding, and accessibility  
- Add **loading indicators** during long operations (e.g. sign-in, API calls)

### 📅 Google Calendar Integration
- Add a toggle for users to choose whether to add events to their calendar  
- Show calendar sync confirmation or status

### 🔍 Event Filtering & Search
- Add filters by event type, city, price range, etc.  
- Use tags or categories for faster navigation

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- Add better error handling for failed login/signup  
- Improve feedback for permission-denied errors

### 📡 Offline Support
- Cache event data locally with **Room** or Firestore’s offline persistence  
- Support offline event sign-ups and sync them when reconnected

### 📊 Analytics & Notifications
- Integrate **Firebase Analytics** to track user behavior  
- Add **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for event reminders or updates

### 🧪 Testing & QA
- Write **unit tests** for critical logic  
- Add **instrumentation tests** for UI flow  
- Use **Firebase Test Lab** for automated device testing

### 🚀 Deployment & Monitoring
- Store user IDs and the event IDs they sign up for in a table for more efficient retrieval instead of storing the entire event information with the user ID.
- Prepare a signed release and publish to the Play Store  
- Use **Firebase Crashlytics** for real-time crash reports
